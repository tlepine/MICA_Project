# MICA project : Matlab Implementation of a Cardiologist Assistant

This project addresses the problem of automated diagnosis of cardiac pathologies, via the signals provided by electrocardiogram (ECG) measurement devices.

The main purpose of this project is to implement basic signal processing algorithms using Matlab
to detect some cardiac pathologies, and develop a graphical user interface (GUI) to load, process and
display ECG, in order to help clinicians through their diagnosis.

This repo provides the necessary sources and informations in order to create your own GUI assistant with MATLAB.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to download the ECG signals and a simple version the assistant. On a Linux or macOS distribution, open a terminal and clone the git repo with the following command : 

```
git clone https://gitlab.com/batalinux/MICA_project.git
```

On a Windows distribution, you need to download a git client (https://git-scm.com/downloads) first.
